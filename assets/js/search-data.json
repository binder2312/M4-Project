The Tesla stock data is imported by use of the package Yfinance, which imports data directly from Yahoo finance. This package allows for import of stock prices by day, but also all the way down to individual minutes or hours of a day. We choose to go by days, and not a more granular level like hours or minutes of days, as we need to be able to match the tweets of a day to the stock prices, and going down to hours or minutes makes this matching much more difficult, and may become a lot more arbitrary, as the hour a tweet is matched to may not be the hour that the tweet actually has an impact on the stock price. Therefore we go by day, in order to reduce the chance of arbitrary matching of stock prices and tweets, although this is still something we need to take into account. . tesla_tick = yf.Ticker(&#39;TSLA&#39;) tesla_tick_real = yf.Ticker(&#39;TSLA&#39;) tesla = tesla_tick.history(interval=&#39;1d&#39;, start=&#39;2020-01-01&#39;, end=&#39;2020-12-19&#39;) tesla_now = tesla_tick_real.history(interval=&#39;1d&#39;, start=&#39;2020-12-18&#39;, end=&#39;2021-01-02&#39;) . tesla .

Twitter data . We collect tweets by use of the the package Twint. It collects the tweets on an individual basis, and collects the newest first by the date and time it is created at. We choose to specify a minimum of likes for each tweet to have to 10, as this reduces the chance of having bots that product spamtweets, which was a problem before we introduced this limit. We do note that this limit is arbitrary in itself, as any given number above a few likes would most likely have sufficed, although a higher number does reduce the chance of bots simply liking bot-created tweets as well. The min likes does, however, also have a practical implication as twint kept crashing, as it reached a threshold of around 30.000-40.000 tweets. Without this limit we would have needed to run Twint 30-40 times over, whereas we only needed to run it twice with this limit. The likes_limit does also reflect som of the thought relating to the impact tha the tweet may have on other peers, as a minimum like of 10 (or any other number for that matter), may indicate som peer-reviewing and agreeableness among twitter-peers, which may very well have an impact on the stock price. We run this code below and save it as two csv-files locally. . #import twint #import nest_asyncio #nest_asyncio.apply() . #c = twint.Config() #c.Search = &quot;$TSLA&quot; #c.Lang = &quot;en&quot; #c.Min_likes = 10 #c.Limit = 1000000 #c.Store_csv = True #c.Output = &quot;$TSLA_minlikes101.csv&quot; #twint.run.Search(c) . With the two csv-files saved locally in colab called $TSLA_minlikes101 and 102. These dataframes are hereafter appended to each other and thereby a single dataframe is created.

After creating our dataframe, we need to filter the tweets by language, as the package we use for sentiment classification later on, can only recognize english text. Twint should have been able to filter based on language, but the implementation of this in Twint did not work when we collected the data. . Furthermore we enforce the minimum likes count as a few tweets with less than 10 slipped by the filter we applied in Twint. . df = df[df[&#39;likes_count&#39;] &gt;= 10] df = df[df.language == &#39;en&#39;] . df.info() . &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; Int64Index: 68586 entries, 1 to 76168 Data columns (total 38 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype -- -- 0 Unnamed: 0 68586 non-null object 1 index 68586 non-null object 2 id 68586 non-null object 3 conversation_id 68586 non-null object 4 created_at 68586 non-null object 5 date 68586 non-null object 6 time 68586 non-null object 7 timezone 68586 non-null float64 8 user_id 68586 non-null object 9 username 68586 non-null object 10 name 68585 non-null object 11 place 0 non-null object 12 tweet 68586 non-null object 13 language 68586 non-null object 14 mentions 68586 non-null object 15 urls 68586 non-null object 16 photos 68586 non-null object 17 replies_count 68586 non-null float64 18 retweets_count 68586 non-null float64 19 likes_count 68586 non-null float64 20 hashtags 68586 non-null object 21 cashtags 68586 non-null object 22 link 68586 non-null object 23 retweet 68586 non-null object 24 quote_url 11898 non-null object 25 video 68586 non-null float64 26 thumbnail 21702 non-null object 27 near 0 non-null float64 28 geo 0 non-null float64 29 source 0 non-null float64 30 user_rt_id 0 non-null float64 31 user_rt 0 non-null float64 32 retweet_id 0 non-null float64 33 reply_to 68586 non-null object 34 retweet_date 0 non-null float64 35 translate 0 non-null float64 36 trans_src 0 non-null float64 37 trans_dest 0 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(15), object(23) memory usage: 20.4+ MB . Next step is to look into the cashtags in order to narrow the scope of cashtags that our twitter data contains. Some tweets contain many different cashtags like $appl and other stocks cashtags, which might be tweets about able that have little relation to Tesla specifically. We do a value count to see the most prominent cashtags, these show up as multiple cashtags if more than one cashtag is used. . df.cashtags.value_counts() .

As we can see the main part of all tweets contain one of the four cashtags with the highest value count, so we remove anything below top 4, which is done simply by removing any cashtag below 1000 occurences: . df = df[df.groupby(&#39;cashtags&#39;)[&#39;cashtags&#39;].transform(&#39;size&#39;) &gt; 1000] . df.cashtags.value_counts() .

Next step is to choose the columns that we will actually need.

We see clear spikes in especially replies, likes and tweets per day, when the stockprice is either in- or decrasing at a rapid pace. The spikes in retweets looks to be less prominent. Do keep in mind that the amount of likes and replies are hard to match to a specific day. When a tweet for instance has a 1000 likes, these may come over the following week. The same can, however, be said about the tweets themselves, even though they are easy to place in time, the effect on the stockprice can only come at a later time than the actual tweet is created at. This does mean though, that they are a better predictor of changes in teslas stock price, as compared likes, replies or retweets, which may come at any given time after the tweet is published. Therefore the count of tweets will be our focus - not because likes, replies and retweets are not just as interesting as predictors, but because we can&#39;t place them in time with the data we have collected. . Another reason for choosing the count of tweets over likes, replies and retweets is that if the classifier we use to find the sentiment of any given tweet classifies wrong, the impact of that misclassification matters much less, as compared to misclassifying a tweet with 40.000 likes. It does also mean that the specific &quot;traction&quot; that a highly liked, replied and/or retweeted tweet can gain, does not play any role, which does not reflect the real world, where one tweet that are highly liked will most likely have a higher impact on Tesla&#39;s stock price as compared ot an identical tweet with few likes. The introduction of a minimum of 10 likes, does ensure that a tweet at least did gain some peer-reviewing. . Sentiment analysis - VADER . To classify whether our data of tweets about $Tsla is regarded as a positive, neutral, or negative tweet we will be using VADER to perform a sentiment analysis. VADER, Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool. This tool is heavenly used to perform sentiment analysis on social media data, which our data in the notebook is (Twitter data). . VADER uses a sentiment lexicon to classify whether features or words can be label as either positive or negative. VADER is pretrained using 10 independent humans to evaluate/rate each token. Each token is rated on a scale from -4 = Extremely Negative to 4 = Extremely Positive. Based on each word vader calculates a compound score, which is used to determine whether a word in it&#39;s given context is more so negative, positive or neutral. . The creators of vader recommends the following rules for the categories: . positive sentiment: compound score &gt;= 0.05 . neutral sentiment: (compound score &gt; -0.05) and (compound score &lt; 0.05) . negative sentiment: compound score &lt;= -0.05 . To see each word or token that VADER has been train to reconise and label the creators of VADER have made this list: https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt . Definition of positive, negative and neutral: . We define positive tweets as tweets that will contribute to a more positive view of Tesla as a company or specifically as a stock and thereby help drive the stockprice up (and not down). . We define negative tweets as tweets that will contribute to a more negative view of Tesla as a company or specifically as a stock and thereby help drive the stockprice down (and not up). (Mukhtar, 2020; Rao &amp; Srivastava, 2012) . Neutral are tweets that will have no effect on the stock price. We do also see the neutral tweets as a bin for VADER to put all the tweets it has a hard time classifying. . sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() . Here are some examples of how VADER classifies twitter data from our dataset: . a = &#39;Thanks Elon. Oh I just followed you so feel free to shoot me a quick Dm next time before you say $tsla stock is too high. I’ve been daytrading to pass the time. Not going great. (Earmuffs SEC)&#39; sid.polarity_scores(a) . {&#39;compound&#39;: 0.1985, &#39;neg&#39;: 0.123, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.736, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.14} . VADER says this is positive, which is kinda true, as this tweet is about Elon Musk saying the stock price is too high, although this tweet is hard to determine what the polarity score should be, as it is hard to discern how this tweet could impact the share prices, as it is a follower who talks about Elon saying the stock is too high, which might make it more neutral. . It perfectly illustrates the problem of classifying tweets, as this can be incredibly hard, even for a person to do. . b = &quot;If you rename companies $tsla = Earth Saver Inc #spacex = Earth Backup Inc @elonmusk&quot; sid.polarity_scores(b) . {&#39;compound&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 1.0, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.0} . Here VADER says it is neutral, whereas this tweet demonstrates a clear bias towards a positive future ahead of Tesla. It is, however, impossible for an algorithm like VADER to take the context of the tweet into consideration (ie. earth saver being positive as we are destroying our planet), as it simply runs each word and sentence by it&#39;s lexicon. . c = &quot;in no particular order&quot; sid.polarity_scores(c) . {&#39;compound&#39;: -0.296, &#39;neg&#39;: 0.423, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.577, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.0} . The code above demonstrates one of the core problems with VADER: &quot;No&quot; makes this sentence negative. . We still choose to use VADER, as it performed the best in our initial test, where we compared it to textblob. Admittedly we did not try any manual labelling and used to train any algorithms by ourself. This might have improved our classification, although it would also have taken much more time. Further refinement could also been done by use of Prodigy, although it came at a cost of 390 dollars, as we, to our knowledge, could not access it without a license as student either. . df[&#39;scores&#39;] = df[&#39;tweet&#39;].apply(lambda tweet: sid.polarity_scores(tweet)) df[&#39;compound&#39;] = df[&#39;scores&#39;].apply(lambda score_dict: score_dict[&#39;compound&#39;]) df[&#39;comp_score&#39;] = df[&#39;compound&#39;].apply(lambda c: &#39;pos&#39; if c &gt; 0.05 else (&#39;neg&#39; if c &lt; -0.05 else &#39;neu&#39;)) df.head() . created_at date username tweet replies_count retweets_count likes_count tweet_count scores compound comp_score . 0 2020-12-18 10:05:50 UTC | 2020-12-18 | alpsoy66 | The key question is, will there be liquidity s... | 3.0 | 0.0 | 12.0 | 1 | {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.764, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.236, &#39;comp... | 0.8689 | pos | . 1 2020-12-18 09:38:06 UTC | 2020-12-18 | eliburton_ | Tesla is more than a stock $tsla https://t.co... | 0.0 | 0.0 | 15.0 | 1 | {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 1.0, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.0, &#39;compound... | 0.0000 | neu | . 2 2020-12-18 09:09:46 UTC | 2020-12-18 | tesla_tizzler | 5/ As for $TSLA, active fund manager buying wi... | 1.0 | 0.0 | 19.0 | 1 | {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.83, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.17, &#39;compou... | 0.5994 | pos | . 3 2020-12-18 09:08:04 UTC | 2020-12-18 | tesla_tizzler | 4/ If this was the case, a group of HFs could ... | 1.0 | 1.0 | 23.0 | 1 | {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.93, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.07, &#39;compou... | 0.5106 | pos | . 4 2020-12-18 09:07:32 UTC | 2020-12-18 | tesla_tizzler | 3/ The large Special Situations funds e.g. Gol... | 1.0 | 1.0 | 21.0 | 1 | {&#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, &#39;neu&#39;: 0.774, &#39;pos&#39;: 0.226, &#39;comp... | 0.7845 | pos | . df.comp_score.value_counts() . pos 26146 neu 16048 neg 13908 Name: comp_score, dtype: int64 .

Elon during yesterday&#39;s ER call: &#34;At our Fremont factory we are producing at roughly the rate NUMMI factory did in it&#39;s record year 2006. Obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year. There is a lot of potential to go beyond this number.&#34; 23864) 0.3818) $TSLA - Raising my YE price target to $1,000. All eyes will now turn to 2021. For 2021, I expect vols of 725K (Fremont X 300K, Y 175K, S/X 50K, China 200K). At $54K ASP, 24% GM, $5B OE, $800M Net Int, 15% Tax Rt, 2021 EPS~$17 @ 60 P/E (w/ 40% L/T EPS growth) ~ $1,000. $TSLAQ 23865) 0.3612) Incredible statement by Piper Sandler&#39;s Alexander Potter on Tesla: &#34;It&#39;s becoming clear, in our view, that $TSLA is on a path toward becoming the world&#39;s only relevant publicly-listed auto maker.&#34; Wow. They who underestimate Toyota, GM, VW, Ford, Honda do so at their own peril. 23866) 0.4404) I hope @GerberKawasaki is ok. 🙏🏻 $TSLA 23867) 0.1779) There was no mention of net reservation growth or number during the $TSLA earnings call yesterday. A big change from prior quarters. Golly, I wonder why. 23868) 0.34) Fun Fact: $TSLA did not disclose a Cybertruck reservation/deposit number in its Q4 2019 earnings presentation or its earnings call. This after Musk was frantically tweeting such numbers in November. Also no comments on the Q4 call about robust Model Y orders. 23869) 0.4215) The $TSLA stuff is very reminiscent of the 2000 bubble action. Analysts are working hard to justify higher multiples and valuations. They are chasing the strength rather than vice-versa. @realmoney 23870) 0.4939) For those paying attention, @jaberwock2 saw this coming, and wrote a superb analysis last October of how the incentives in Europe of all OEMs but $TSLA was to hold off delivering EVs in 2019, but ramp up massively in 2020. https://t.co/3gSyKW5o7f 23871) 0.4588) The importantance of FSD is unmatched in history, so any change in confidence that Tesla will achieve autonomy and will command a multi-year lead is material. This is under-appreciated by investors. $TSLA #NotSellingAShareBefore10000 23872) 0.3818) Alex Potter from Piper Sandler raises Tesla $TSLA PT to $729 after Q4 earnings. &#34;It&#39;s becoming clear, in our view, that #Tesla is on a path toward becoming the world&#39;s only relevant publicly listed auto maker.&#34; 23873) 0.7057) Good Morning Campers!

The below upgrade option alone may add hundreds of millions of dollars to Tesla&#39;s bottom-line in the coming quarters. $TSLA #NotSellingAShareBefore5000 23878) 0.5574) Tesla’s #ModelY wiring plan is revolutionary: ~93% reduction to ~100 meters.

Analyst: a crappy autonomy play? 23882) 0.6245) 1) We can all agree that $TSLA&#39;s only hope for growth this year is China &amp;amp; it&#39;s not looking good right now. In fact, @elonmusk inadvertently admitted as much on today&#39;s conf-call, when saying the MIC Model 3 price cut was made to generate volume.

Incoming Model Y, Model X is going back to Tesla on lease soon. $TSLA strong. https://t.co/GUFXR1Zpbv 23902) 0.4939) 6) All in, it appears like $TSLA magically printed $1bn in FCF via Inventory, Accounts Payable, &amp;amp; suppressed capex (surely there&#39;s more). Counting just the above, FCF should&#39;ve been only $112m, which would&#39;ve been 82% lower than consensus of $630m. 23903) 0.4913) 5) Also, why was capex so low in Q4, leading to undershooting even $TSLA&#39;s lowered 2019 capex guidance of $1.5bn? I was expecting at least $600m in Q4 capex, but $TSLA only spent $412m despite having GF3 &amp;amp; Model Y projects in full gear. So another $188m boost to FCF? 23904) 0.755) 4) Accounts Payable were up 9% QoQ ($300m). Despite having Purchase Obligations for 2019 amounting to $4.9bn at the start of the year, why did AP increase by $367m YoY? Was this something related to the special &#34;purchase agreements&#34; $TSLA mentioned they made in their Q3&#39;19 10-Q? 23905) 0.7804) 1) I&#39;m befuddled by the after-hour spike in $TSLA by 12%. Q4&#39;19 was a shit quarter: a) GAAP Net Profit of $105m was 17% below consensus of $126m. b) Net profit fell by 26% QoQ despite 16% higher deliveries. c) Ex-ZEV/GHG credits, Q4 NP was -$28m vs Q3&#39;s $9m.

We don&#39;t hear much about them, but you can still see what $TSLA owes vs what they&#39;re worth.. Hint: less... 6/7 25706) 0.5423) Only, they weren&#39;t totally out of sight. About 1.6b of RVGs were reclassified to SRR. The remainder stayed in leasing. and inn 2019, $TSLA had to take a 550m charge in SRR for these vehicles as it became clear they weren&#39;t going to be worth what $TSLA thought. 5/7 25707) 0.8779) It was a clever strategy. $TSLA received full purchase price in exchange for a promise, if needed, to buy the car back in the future at a set price, the RVG. Until 2017, $TSLA booked the transactions as leases. The disclosure was pretty clear. 3/7 https://t.co/JC20gMLo6y 25708) 0.9451) 6 years ago is starting to come due. Accounting rule changes and effective obfuscation of relevant disclosures has it pretty well buried. The Resale Value Guarantee (RVG) began ramping in 2014. It&#39;s intent was to boost $TSLA sales by guaranteeing 2ndry market values. 2/7 25709) 0.9468) One of $TSLA&#39;s core strengths is the willingness to promise the future to boost it&#39;s present. Solar tiles FSD 35k M3 Pana purchase commitments pickup truck semi robotaxis etc. It&#39;s a talent they&#39;ve honed over the last 8 years. One clever promise, first made over 1/7 25710) 0.765) I remember back about 18 years ago when every broker on the street had a big buy target on #Nortel at +$128.

Most of the tweets in neutral are misclassified as VADER stumples on a sentence that is highly context dependent or contains unknown words, weird spacing or use of symbols. As we run through the neutral tweets, we see that a higher proportion of the tweets are positive, rather than negative, when we do our subjective evaluation of the first 300 tweets. The proportion of tweets that are postive are around 170 out of 300 and 100 are negative. 30 tweets we had trouble classifying ourselves. This proportion of positive vs. negative does somewhat correspond to the difference among positive tweets that VADER classified as compared to negative (around 26000 positive vs 14000 negative) If this is the case, we can remove all these neutral tweets, without changing the relative distribution of positive vs negative tweets. We do not wan&#39;t to keep that neutral tweets, as these tweets are clearly not neutral overall. The only way to handle these tweets proporly would be to manually label them or improve VADER, which might be very difficult as things like context-specific knowledge of where the stockprice is at the moment would have to be added to VADER&#39;s source code. . df = df[df.comp_score != &#39;neu&#39;].reset_index(drop=True) .

Topic modelling . In order to see how the sentiment classifier VADER performs at a higher level of abstraction, topic modelling can be used. This provides an easier way of seeing how different topics relate and which topics are classified as negative as compared to positive. We use TF-IDF as a representation of words. We tried a bag-of-word representation, but this did not create as interesting topics. This is likely due to a high term frequency in individually (locally) and a low frequency across all negative or positive tweets, will result in a higher TF-IDF score, whereas the BOW will give a high weight to just frequently appearing words.

We see more negative words like &quot;fraud&quot;, &quot;shorted&quot;, &quot;lose&quot;, and an overall more negative vibe. This tells us that our sentiment classifier VADER has at least had some success classifying the tweets in a way, that did manage to create different key tokens across the positive and negative topics. . Adding timedelta to tweets and grouping by day . Because Nasdaq closes 21:00 PM UTC, it is likely that tweets published after this time, will only be able to influence the stock price the next day, so in order to compensate for this, we add a timedelta to the tweets of 3 hours, so when NASDAQ closes, the date changes. This is a very simple and basic way, and assumes all trading days have the usual opening hours, but it does solve most of this issue of matching tweets to days. . df[&#39;created_at&#39;] =

Strategy based off twitterdata . We have 3 hypothesis as to to what data fram twitter we can use for our trading strategy. . The first hypothethis is that we can use the compound score (sentiment) to determine wether we should buy or sell the stock. The logic here is the same as in the moving average. We try to smooth out the sentiment for the tesla data by creating a constantly updated average sentiment. The logic is that we can see when the sentiment shifts from being positive to negatve and vice verca and this will create a buy/sell signal. . | The second hypothethis is that we use the amount of negative and positive tweet as we think this could create a buy/sell signall aswell. . | The third hypothethis is that we use the total amount of tweets pr. day to give us buy/sell signals. . | comp_short_window = 5 comp_long_window = 25 comp_short = pd.DataFrame() comp_short[&#39;score&#39;] = df_combined[&#39;compound&#39;].rolling(window= comp_short_window).mean() #using 5 days comp_short . score . 0 NaN | . 1 NaN | . 2 NaN | . 3 NaN | . 4 17.45306 | . ... ... | . 347 37.60390 | . 348 35.10000 | . 349 37.20410 | . 350 43.93874 | . 351 42.55422 | . 352 rows × 1 columns . comp_long = pd.DataFrame() comp_long[&#39;score&#39;] = df_combined[&#39;compound&#39;].rolling(window=comp_long_window).mean() # using 20 days comp_long . score . 0 NaN | . 1 NaN | . 2 NaN | . 3 NaN | . 4 NaN | . ... ... | . 347 37.961352 | . 348 38.916684 | . 349 39.606428 | . 350 41.444708 | . 351 40.096776 | . 352 rows × 1 columns . plt.figure(figsize=(12.5 , 4.5)) plt.plot(df_combined[&#39;close&#39;], label =&#39;stockprice&#39;) plt.plot(comp_short[&#39;score&#39;]*5, label = &#39;compound shortterm&#39;) plt.plot(comp_long[&#39;score&#39;]*5, label = &#39;compound longterm&#39;) plt.title(&#39;price history&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;jan. 01 - dec 18&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Close price $&#39;) plt.legend(loc=&#39;upper left&#39;) plt.show() . strategy_1 = pd.DataFrame() strategy_1[&#39;short&#39;] = comp_short[&#39;score&#39;] strategy_1[&#39;long&#39;] = comp_long[&#39;score&#39;] strategy_1[&#39;tsla&#39;] = df_combined[&#39;close&#39;] strategy_1 . short long tsla . 0 NaN | NaN | 86.0500 | . 1 NaN | NaN | 88.6000 | . 2 NaN | NaN | 89.0275 | . 3 NaN | NaN | 89.4550 | . 4 17.45306 | NaN | 90.3100 | . ... ... | ... | ... | . 347 37.60390 | 37.961352 | 639.8300 | . 348 35.10000 | 38.916684 | 633.2500 | . 349 37.20410 | 39.606428 | 622.7700 | . 350 43.93874 | 41.444708 | 655.9000 | . 351 42.55422 | 40.096776 | 695.0000 | . 352 rows × 3 columns . def buy_sell(df): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function that creats buy and sell signals when moving average crosses eachother.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Neural net . In order to see whether or not positive and negative tweets counts can be used for forecasting, we implement two LSTM&#39;s, one that predicts based upon closing price, volume, high and low price. Another is trained on the same stock data, but on top of that the positive and negative tweet count is included, in order to see if it provides any improvement to the RMSE-score. The used algorithm is LSTM, which stands for Long-short term memory, which is demonstrated by Jin, Yang &amp; Liu (2019) to be a viable choice when predicting stock prices based upon stock data and sentiment analysis. The implemented LSTM&#39;s are very basic in structure, and only serve to demonstrate if incorporation of our twitter sentiment data improves the model performance. This may indicate that twitter sentiments can be viable for stock forecasting, even though our sentiment classification is far from perfect. . We forecast one day ahead, based upon five days of prior data, and run this as a loop over the entire dataframe. This is chosen as the performance improved, when we shortened the data we used as input to forecast on. 1 day ahead follows what Jin, Yang and Liu (2019) did, and is a logical choice as one day is the nearest, we can forecast ahead in time, and therefore reduces the uncertainty compared to forecasting 2 or more days ahead. . The models are trained using a batch_size = 1, as the data it is given is minimal. To keep things equal the models are given &quot;Closing price&quot;, &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;. &quot;Volume&quot; and other stock data generally decreased performance. On top of model 1 is given, model 2 is given tweet_count_negative and tweet_count_positive. Both models are run for 30 epochs, to keep things the same. While overfitting is technically a thing, what is crucial here is how well the model predicts one day ahead for data it has not seen before, which is what we asks the models to do for 19-12-2020. .

I can see here that the loss score is decreasing for both the training and test set in each epoch as well as the accuracy is increasing which is the goal for this step here where i want to achieve a low loss and a high accuracy meaning that the model is as precise as it can be. The reason why i didn&#39;t choose more epochs is because the training set starts to get overfitted from here. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE val_accuracy IS FOUND UNDER THE &#39;Epoch 1/6 157/157&#39;. . plt.plot(r.history[&#39;accuracy&#39;]) plt.plot(r.history[&#39;val_accuracy&#39;]) plt.title(&#39;Model Accuracy&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Accuracy&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Epoch&#39;, labelpad=2) plt.legend([&#39;train&#39;, &#39;test&#39;], loc=&#39;upper left&#39;) plt.show() . From this i can see that both the train and test set is improving over the 6 epochs and then ending up being approximately the same in the last epoch. (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - so six) . plt.plot(r.history[&#39;loss&#39;]) plt.plot(r.history[&#39;val_loss&#39;]) plt.title(&#39;Loss&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Loss&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Epoch&#39;) plt.legend([&#39;train&#39;, &#39;test&#39;], loc=&#39;upper right&#39;) plt.show() . The same is the case for the loss score, where the graphs are almost meeting each other in the 6th epoch which means that it is the near perfect fit. . I had a lot of trouble finding a good match, where in many cases the model ended up being overfit - being that the training set was improving really quick ending on 0.98 on the accuracy score but with high loss score on the validation set - which should be as low as possible. I have both tried adding more layers to the model and also adjusting the number of neurons in the layers, but i found that keeping the model on few layers with few neurons and a high dropout rate gave me the best performing neural net. . So this means that the model will be able to detect a fake tweet with an accuracy of 86%. . !jupyter nbconvert --to html &quot;/content/M3A1.ipynb&quot; .",
